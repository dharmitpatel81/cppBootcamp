C++ is designed as a compiled language rather than an interpreted language.

Compiler: 
    A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs. 

Interpreter: 
    An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.
