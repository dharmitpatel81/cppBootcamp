X---------------------------- [Stay away from Friend keyword in C++ ðŸ’€] ---------------------------------X

- A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private and protected members of other classes.

    Syntax : friend class class_name;    // declared in the base class

- We can declare friend class or function anywhere in the base class body whether its private, protected or public block. It works all the same.

- Disadvantages of Friend Functions:
    1. Friend functions have access to private members of a class from outside the class which violates the law of data hiding (create security issues).
    2. Friend functions cannot do any run-time polymorphism in their members.
